# PopStash Development Summary & TODO

## Latest Session Updates

### üîß Recent Changes
- **Issue Identified**: Text editor broke after our changes - can no longer edit text in popup
- **OSLog Implementation**: Replaced cringe emoji print statements with professional OSLog
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed dead code files (PopManager.swift, PopEditorView.swift) 
- **Architecture Investigation**: Comparing current approach vs original working version

### üö® Current Problems
1. **Text Editor Broken**: Inline text editor in popup no longer allows editing
2. **"First Time" Bug**: Popup doesn't show until you click menu bar icon first, then works
3. **Build Error**: SwiftUI Scenes don't have `.onAppear` - using wrong lifecycle methods

### üéØ Analysis: What Changed vs Working Version
**Original Working Setup** (commit 54c6d0a):
- ClipboardManager created in AppDelegate, not SwiftUI @State
- No `.task` or `.onAppear` on MenuBarExtra 
- Setup handled entirely in AppDelegate
- Used `if let clipboardManager = appDelegate.clipboardManager` pattern

**Current Broken Setup**:
- ClipboardManager as @State in PopStashApp
- Setup happening in SwiftUI .task
- More complex state management
- Text editor mysteriously broken

## What We've Accomplished Today

### üöÄ Project Recovery
- **Problem**: PopStash-2 was completely broken - build hanging at 115/129, indexing stuck
- **Cause**: AI had renamed files and broken references throughout codebase
- **Solution**: Started fresh with clean clone and rebuilt functionality incrementally

### ‚úÖ Successfully Implemented

#### 1. KeyboardShortcuts Framework Integration
- **Added**: `KeyboardShortcuts.swift` with shortcut definitions
- **Implemented**: Full shortcut system in `ClipboardManager.swift`
- **Shortcuts Working**:
  - `Option+C`: Primary capture (copy selected text + show popup)
  - `Shift+Option+C`: Secondary access (use existing clipboard + show popup)
  - `Option+1` through `Option+9`: Quick paste from clipboard history

#### 2. Modern @Observable State Management
- **Updated**: `ClipboardManager` uses `@Observable` (not legacy `@Published`)
- **Fixed**: Proper state binding throughout app
- **Working**: Real-time clipboard history updates

#### 3. Text Editor Popup System
- **Status**: WORKING PERFECTLY (keeping as-is!)
- **Features**: 
  - Inline text editor (not separate component)
  - Proper focus management
  - Save/Cancel functionality
  - Live clipboard updates
  - Correct positioning in topTrailing area

#### 4. Project Structure Cleanup
- **Fixed**: PopEditor.swift integration issues (was missing from Xcode project)
- **Resolved**: Build hanging issues by using fresh clone
- **Working**: Clean build process with no errors

#### 5. Professional Logging System ‚úÖ NEW
- **Replaced**: All emoji print statements with OSLog
- **Added**: Proper privacy protection for sensitive data
- **Implemented**: Category-based logging (main, delegate, clipboard, popup)
- **Benefits**: Performance optimized, Console.app integration, proper log levels

### üîÑ Current Issues

### üîÑ Current Issues

#### 1. Text Editor Regression ‚ùå BROKEN
- **Status**: Was working perfectly, now broken after our changes
- **Issue**: TextEditor in popup no longer allows text editing
- **Suspected Cause**: SwiftUI Window vs WindowGroup differences, or state binding changes

#### 2. First-Time Popup Bug ‚ùå BROKEN  
- **Issue**: Keyboard shortcut doesn't show popup on first press
- **Workaround**: Works after clicking menu bar icon once
- **Cause**: openWindow callback not connected at app launch

#### 3. SwiftUI Scene Lifecycle Issues ‚ùå BUILD ERROR
- **Issue**: Using `.onAppear` on Scene (invalid - Scenes don't have onAppear)
- **Fix**: Remove Scene-level .onAppear, use only .task on Views

## üéØ Critical TODOs (Session Priority)

## üéØ Critical TODOs (Session Priority)

### Option A: Revert to Original Working Pattern ‚ö° RECOMMENDED
- [ ] Revert PopStashApp to match commit 54c6d0a structure  
- [ ] Move ClipboardManager creation back to AppDelegate
- [ ] Remove SwiftUI-based setup (.task, complex state management)
- [ ] Test if this fixes both text editor and first-time popup issues

### Option B: Fix Current Approach üîß MORE COMPLEX
- [ ] Fix SwiftUI Window vs WindowGroup text input handling
- [ ] Resolve openWindow callback timing issues  
- [ ] Debug why TextEditor binding broke
- [ ] Remove Scene-level .onAppear (build error)

### Immediate Actions (Either Path)
- [ ] Fix build error by removing Scene .onAppear
- [ ] Test which approach restores text editor functionality
- [ ] Verify keyboard shortcuts work consistently

## üìã Previous Session Accomplishments

## üìã Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Rename NotificationPopup* ‚Üí Pop* (if desired)
- [ ] Extract PopEditor as separate component (if needed)
- [ ] Add PopManager for state organization
- [ ] Image clipboard support
- [ ] Advanced settings panel
- [ ] Custom keyboard shortcut configuration

### Don't Touch (Working Well)
- ‚ùå Current text editor implementation
- ‚ùå Popup positioning system
- ‚ùå @Observable state management
- ‚ùå Core clipboard capture logic

## üö¶ Status

**MVP READY FOR USER TESTING**

All critical development tasks completed:
1. ‚úÖ **AppDelegate Integration Complete** - setClipboardManager method added, legacy code removed
2. ‚úÖ **PopStashApp Modernization Complete** - Modern SwiftUI structure with .task lifecycle
3. ‚úÖ **KeyboardShortcuts Fully Integrated** - All shortcuts implemented and ready
4. ‚úÖ **Text Editor System Working** - Inline popup editor functioning perfectly

## üìù Lessons Learned

- **Never let AI rename core files** - Breaks everything
- **Fresh clone approach works** - Better than fixing broken references
- **Incremental building is safer** - Test after each addition
- **Keep working code working** - Don't "improve" what's not broken
